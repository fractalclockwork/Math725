    " - $P\\vee Q:$\n",
    "     - Assume $P$ is false and prove $Q$, or assume $Q$ is false and prove $P$.\n",

    " - $\\forall xP(x):$\n",
    "     - Let $x$ stand for an arbitrary object, and prove $P(x)$. (If the letter $x$ already stands for something in the proof, you will have to use a different letter for the arbitary object.)\n",
